    <h2>Free Agency Outlook</h2>
    <h3>Who the Broncos Should be looking to Sign in Free Agency</h3>
</section>
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <p class="col-3"><img src="chris-harris.jpg" alt="Chris Harris Jr." width="100%" height="50%">Perhaps the biggest player that the broncos need to resign is star corner back, Chris Harris Jr.. Chris has been a all pro, pro bowl player and part of the Broncos defense for so long. Even with his age he must be resigned.</p>
        <p class="col-3"><img src="derekewolfe.jpg" alt="Derek Wolfe" width="100%" height="50%">The Broncos team sack lader before his injury is Derek Wolfe and a capatian of the team is another huge free agency piece the Broncos should look to resign. Even though he is injured again his leadership cannot be over stated and she should be resigned.</p>
        <p class="col-3"><img src="amaricooper.jpg" alt="Amari Cooper" width="100%" height="50%">WHile there is no guarauntee that that Ameri Cooper will be a free agent even the fact the Broncos could obtain him should excite them. This is a player that could join forces with Courtland Sutton and make a dynamic duo out of both of them.</p>
        <p class="col-3"><img src="brandonscherff.webp" alt="Brandon Scherff" width="100%" height="50%>">One if the top guards in the league could be a extreme assets to the Broncos to pair with rising rookie dalton risner. Brandon Scherff would almost complete the Broncos line and help sure up one of there overall weakness. His hefty contract may hurt but, he is worth the money.</p>

    <h2 class="KT">Key Takeaways</h2>
    <p class="KT">This Broncos free agency  is different from many others in the past in the fact that they are both trying to maintain veteran leaders and obtain players needed to complete the roster. THe Broncos have a decent amount of money to play around with so I wouldnt be surprised if the manage to make a couple of higher priced bids than they have in the past. After this free agency could turn the franchise around if the Bronos are abel to gain youth and add in their key area of weaknesses.</p>
