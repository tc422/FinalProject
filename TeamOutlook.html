    <div class="row">
        <p class="col-3"><img src="DrewLock.jpeg" alt="Drew Lock" width="100%" height="50%">The big question in the Backfield is Drew Lock there new quarterback, the Missouri quarterback is still young and now starting. The rest of the backfield coming along nicely with key young pieces such as Noah Fant, Courtland sutton and Phillip Lindsay.</p>
        <p class="col-3"><img src="dalton-risner.jpg" alt="Dalton Risner" width="100%" height="50%">The Offensive line is the weakest position on that thr Broncos have at the moment. They have missed on multiple players such as Garrett Bolles and Ron Leary. However young star Dalton Risner and Juwaun James are promising.</p>
        <p class="col-3"><img src="von-miller.jpg" alt="Von Miller" width="100%" height="50%">The Defensive line is a and Linebackers is a place where the Broncos currently have some aging pieces and some youthful pieces. They are leaning veterans Derek Wolfe, Todd Davis and Von Miller to help. They have new young stars in AJ Johnson and Bradley Chubb.</p>
        <p class="col-3"><img src="justinsimmons.jpeg" alt="Justin Simmons" width="100%" height="50%">The Defensive Backs are some of the strengths of the Broncos Defense. With Budding stars like Justin Simmons, Kareem Jackson and Bryce Callahan they are in good shape. They also have help from star player Chris Harris JR.</p>

<h2 class="KT">Key Takeaways</h2>
<p class="KT">The Broncos look like the type of team that are just one year away from competing for the whole championship, they have young talent in all the right places and are playing very competitive football losing most their games in the final quarter. However they have been missing that quarterback for a while and it is still yet to be seen if Drew Lock will step up and be that guy for years to come. That plus some aging pieces the Broncos are going to have to be smart over the next couple of years in order to keep competing</p>
