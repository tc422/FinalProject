    <h3>Who the Broncos Should be looking to Draft</h3>

    <div class="row">
        <p class="col-3"><img src="jeffreyokudah.jpg" alt="Jeffrey Okudah" width="100%" height="50%">One of the biggest needs that the Broncos have is in there aging defense, especially with Chris Harris Jr. a soon to be free agent. That's why I believe Jeffrey Okudah is the right player out of Ohio State.</p>
        <p class="col-3"><img src="AndrewThomas.webp" alt="Andrew Thomas" width="100%" height="50%">With Garrett Bolles failing to live to the hype that was the first round pick. Andrew Thomas out of Gerogia is the perfect snag. He is the best all around tackle in the class and is in general a very solid tackle.</p>
        <p class="col-3"><img src="tylanwallace.jpg" alt="Tylan Wallace" width="100%" height="50%">The broncos have been missing the slot reciever position since Wes Welker retired and with a deep reciever class Tylan Wallace could fall to them in the second round. He is one of the shiftiest wide recievers in the class and just a ll around good reciever.</p>
        <p class="col-3"><img src="troydye.jpg" alt="Troy Dye" width="100%" height="50%">With the emergence of A.J. Johsnon the Broncos are now just missing a companion for him. Enter Troy Dye, he is one of the best athletes at the linebacker position who could take over the cover role immediately and play quality football</p>

    <h2 class="KT">Key Takeaways</h2>
    <p class="KT">The Broncos are missing just a couple pieces if Drew Lock is their quarterback of the future. If the Broncos and turn this draft class into another strong showing, they could end up in the playoffs very soon. This is not mention that John Elway's job may be on the line considering that the broncos have not had a extremely productive draft class in the years that he took over the saddle. With his job on the line and a very good class in the places the Broncos sneed this could be a very easy year given the level of players that the Broncos could be drafting from.</p>
